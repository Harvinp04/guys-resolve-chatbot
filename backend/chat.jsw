Our approach to therapy
Most of all, guys, if you've never been to therapy before, and many of our clients are coming to us for a first experience with it, think of it as a relaxed, sometimes deep, conversation with someone who has your best interests in mind, has zero judgement of you, (will maybe call out some behaviours or patterns of thinking as unhealthy, which you probably knew already, but who won't judge you, as a person), and know that ultimately, you're in control. 

 

Therapy is 'consent based' which means that you don't have to do or talk about anything that you don't want to do or talk about. It's up to you. You don't want to continue working with us? That's your call. We take an approach to something that you don't think works for you? No problem. There are usually multiple ways to tackle just about everything, so ask. Yes, different therapists can have their own 'style'. But science is science, and as long as something is an evidence-based approach, and we are adequately familiar with it, we can adapt to you. It's not for you to adapt to your therapist. If your therapist can't find a way to work effectively with you, communicate that with them, give it an honest try, and if it's not working for you, find another one.  We'll even make a referral if we can.
